### Manifesto on Design

Technology. A tool to make living easier and ideally meant to aid humans. So many ways to apply it. It could be done in a direct and blunt manner, such as computers or phones. Or it could be done in discreet ways, such as the gears of a windmill powering energy for cities. Either way, it is obvious that technology dictates many of our actions and influences our behavior. In this manifesto I will portray my design and the driving motivations behind it. 


## Personal Code of Ethics:
While useful, technology shouldn’t have an absolute influence on our lives.
Technology shouldn’t be invasive and harm us, physically or mentally
Should always have supervision to ensure effectiveness 
Should be made with the best interests in mind (not made for negative reasons)
Users must understand what the technology or design entails when using it
Fluid communication between designer and the directed audience 
	

## Accessibility of Design
When approaching a design, make sure to always think on how to introduce said design to humans while thinking of its effectiveness
Think of all possible scenarios when designing
Think of all possible types of people that might use your design
Think of ways to incorporate effectively
Accessibility in my Design
The CCC made the app to make finding people’s respective busses and snack stations easier and less stressful
First we thought of what the core topics would be
Thought of what type of medium would be used to convey our design
Could have been an app, website, posters, etc.
Once the design was near finished, we focused more on how to make the app itself more accessible
This meant interviewing participants to improve our design


## Use of External Advice
Despite being the creator of your design, implementing advice from external voices (participants, advisors, peers) is always beneficial and might open your view on other problems
Interviewing people among the area or community where your design will be implemented will help tweak your design to have it fit in better
Make sure to interview many types of people from all types of groups to have a wide range of information
Use varying types of interviews to extract information
Implement the use of one-to-one interviews in a conversation style with a casual connotation 
This was used in our design during early stages to see what people needed help with
Use a preconceived method of interviewing with prepared questions to extract the specific information you need
This method was used in the later stages when all we needed was specific info.
Use a more observant manner of interviews when all you need to see is how a person acts in daily surroundings
Used throughout the design process to observe how our participants dealt with the problems


## Development of Outlines
Development of ideas
Doesn’t even have a linear method of thinking 
Merely writing down thoughts and isolating those that seem the best
Quantity of Quality in this stage
Coming up with a clear and basic outline
Once the ideas are written down in paper, begin developing a rough sketch of how those ideas connect in order to develop a clear outline
Once outline is complete, begin combining your design with the outline and edit it to fit your design
Use the information gained from interviews to improve outline
Making a task flow 
By doing so it will break down the problem you are making the design for
Making it less descriptive but very clear helps to spread it out
Once set up, single out the tasks that you have to focus on 
Once the tasks are chosen, and the design is near finish, begin creating paper prototypes 
By doing putting your design into pen and paper, it will make it easier to identify any flaws that are present
Making many paper prototypes and putting them next to each other will allow you to take pieces from each that work well
Final outlines
Once the paper prototypes are done, begin setting up a final outline digitally and start formatting it to your chosen design type
A relatively high fidelity outline that effectively summarizes everything you are trying to do and breaks it down 



## Exporting Design into the Real World
The final step which we weren’t able to do
Once the beta version is completed release it to a small portion of the audience
By doing so it will show how it works in a real life situation
Feedback is crucial in this stage
All feedback will be important to keep in mind because later on it will be released to the whole public
Final version is released	
Once the revision of the beta version are done and the design has been carefully inspected, it is ready to be shown to the rest of the public
Hopefully, it works and if there are any problems that arise, it is important to fix them
Sit back and watch your design solve your original goal :)


Before starting this journey, the complexity of design never crossed my mind. I knew how useful it was, but I never truly knew how much effort went into its development. After this class and project, I have come to realize how complex design is. However, by breaking down design into attainable steps, it seems much easier. Additionally, I had to think of ways to incorporate ethics into my design and how to center it around the people that I was trying to help.
