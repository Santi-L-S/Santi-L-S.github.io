#### Individual Project Proposal

## Article Proposal

  A design flaw I noticed was part of a very broad theme, space. Here in Horace Mann, we have a campus filled with fields and buildings. 
One would imagine that with the amount of space, there is never a specific place that is overcrowded. However, that is not the case. 
Because of the amount of space that is granted to the students, they tend to group together in specific locations. These locations become overcrowded 
and become a hindrance for people passing by. There are two locations that I observed where I saw this play out. They were the library and Alumni Field.

  It is widely accepted that in the library people should be quiet and work silently or in groups. But because of the size of the student boy, having a quiet library 
is near impossible. Horace Mann solved part of the problem by making soundproof meeting rooms for groups to hang out, and making the second floor a place of work and silence. 
However, if you enter the library during any break, it is extremely loud and rowdy. There are many cliques of different grades that form on the first floor. 
Many people are screaming and all the seats are taken. Mind you this isn’t some small library. If you want to do work on the first floor, 
you can forget about it because you won’t be able to focus due to your surroundings. Even the students doing work on the second floor will hear the noise coming from below; 
although it won’t affect them as much since the chairs are off to the sides. However, there is another side to these cons. Because there is such a dense mass of people, 
it allows people to connect and talk with people from different grades and with different experiences. This could lead to cliques, but by connecting different students together 
that otherwise wouldn’t interact with each other, it could result in a stronger and closer community. But by forming cliques, facilitating community engagement 
gets harder. It is great to have a close group of friends, but when we individuals are a part of a community, engaging with everyone in the community 
would result in a positive effect.


  The second observation regarding space is in Alumni Field. This field is situated in the middle of the campus and is the size of a football field. 
It clearly has lots of room and space. During most of the day, there might be a few people outside playing some sort of sport and a few PE classes. 
However, during D and E period, when the middle schoolers have their lunch free, the field is completely full. There are PE classes in some sections of the field, 
some students are having lunch, some are just chilling on the ground, and others are playing frisbee or spikeball. This lack of space can lead to injuries or accidents. 
Finding a way to minimize these moments where there is a lack of space would greatly help people: get through their day and allow for more relaxed spaces.
