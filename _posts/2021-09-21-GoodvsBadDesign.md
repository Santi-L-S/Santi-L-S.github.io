### Good vs Bad Design 
## Good Design
The release of the airpod was met with a lot of hype and good reviews. Why? The classic white earpods that everyone used previously worked but the wires constantly got tangled and people would struggle in an attempt to free them. However, the new airpods didn't have such setbacks. With no wire and the addition of noise cancellation, the airpod was a better upgrade of the previous earpods. The new design with a rubber piece that inserts into the ear canal prevents the airpod from falling out of the ear when using them for physical activity. With simple signifiers and increased number of affordances, the newsly imagined airpod was a great design.
