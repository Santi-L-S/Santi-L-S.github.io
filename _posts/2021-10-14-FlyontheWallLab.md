### Fly On the Wall Lab

## Observations
During my time observing different interactions between students at HM I collected data that ranged from people working silently in the basement of Lutnik or large groups of upper classmen playing outside.
I observed 10 moments with students on the campus.

# Observation #1
The first thing I observed during the Fly on the Wall Lab was watching a group of seniors playing volleyball next to bleachers. There were four of them, two girls, and two boys. It was about 2:00 pm and there weren't many people out at the time. They were under the shade and were playing keep up with a volleyball. The boys were both wearing hoodies and they girls were wearing leggings and hoodies as well. They were all excited and laughing.

# Observation #2
This observation was conducted in the basement of Lutnick. It was H period and there were little to no people in the basement. There were about 5 people scattered and they were working on their laptops. They all had some sort of headphones of airpods and listened to music. They kept working for about 20 minutes and then packed their bags. It was time to leave and go on the busses. 3 of the 5 went through the exit in the basement that gives direct access to the road. 

# Observation #3
During D period, 2 boys were playing tennis on the tennis courts behind Lutnick. They were probably middleschoolers and were wearing sports clothes. It was a hot day and the sun was hitting the courts. They weren't technically good at tennis but they having a good, I infered from the smiles and laughs. Eventually, one of them hit the ball over the fence and went into Lutnick to get some water.

# Observation #4 
As I was going down the stair in Tillinghast, I saw a girl sitting next to the charging area in the basement. She was charging her phone, airpods, and laptop. While she was waiting she was reading a book. I saw this during B period, meaning not many people were out and about, so it was quiet enough to read a book. She kept reading until the into-to-engineering class was let out. As they walked out of the class she packed up her laptop and put her phone and airpods into her pocket.

# Observation #5
There were a group of middle schoolers playing soccer during D period. It was towards the end of the period and it was a cloudy day. The middle schoolers had just finished their lunch and about 15 middle schoolers were playing soccer on the goal facing the trainers room and the gym. They were full of energy and didn't stop until the end of the period. 

# Observation #6
On the way back from lunch I saw a group of Juniors sitting on alumni field having lunch. It was a sunny day but it wasn't too hot to be outside. There were about 8 people and they all had food. They stayed on the field and ten minutes before the end of that period. As they picked up their backpacks only about half of them picked up their trash and threw it out. The rest of them just left wrappers and napkins on the ground.

# Observation #7
I saw a group of highschoolers in one of the meeting rooms in the library. They were relaxing on the bean bags and were playing hangman on the white board. They kept playing and as they left, they erased everything on the board and came out of the room talking loudly. They disrupted the quit of the library for a few seconds and then they left and went down the stairs.

# Observation #8
On the first floor of Lutnick, a group of sophmores were eating food and talking loudly. Some were eating and others were talking. However, all of them had their masks off. A teacher passed by and told them to wear their masks. Some did and others ignored the teacher. Once they left the chairs and tables, they left trash and food all over the place.

# Observation #9
In the cafeteria, a group of highschoolers were pushing their way through some middle schoolers and bumped into a few of them. They then got their food, water, utensils, and then left the cafeteria. They only ate a few bites of their food and then threw it all out.

# Observation #10
The final observation was a large group of highschoolers blocking the way into Tilinghast and a bunch of students were trying to get in. There was pushing and shoving and the highschoolers eventually moved out of the way. However, many students were late to their classes and their tests/quizess

# Analysis 
Looking at all the different observations, I divided them into two big catagories:
Outside vs. Inside

Outside: Observations that I recorded outside generally had to do with the fact that it is okay to take off your mask and the space allows for sports or physicall activity

Inside: In this category, two big contrasts are pinned. Some people went inside to do work, relax, or go to the library. Others went inside to socialize and hang out in big groups. 

# Process of Finding the Observations
I spent the time given to us in class to observe in Lutnick and in the library. I also spent a lot of time outside of class to observe moments in the cafeteria, the field, and Tilinghast. I worked with Jiyon during the time alloted to us during class. Some of the methods I used included sitting near whatever I was observing and glancing there secretely. However there were a few times where I was sitting down doing something else and out of no where people appeared and began to do things. In that case I merely had to stop what I was doin, open my code and add another observation. Those observations that I only recorded by chance were super satisfying and they were fun to watch. Something that didn't work was when I got too close to the people/group I was observing, it got kind of suspicious and I ended getting up and leaving. There were a few days were I had frees but forgot about the lab and didn't go out to write down observations. During this lab I was able to understand how big the community of HM is and how intricate it is.
